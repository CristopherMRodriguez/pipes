# pipes

Purpose of this app is to strengthen a bagpiper's repotoire of music.  The app generates a random tune based on the "style" 
that is selected.  

The user can continue to generate more tunes from that style until the array runs out. When the array runs out the page
refreshes.

The user can also switch to a new "style."

The app features downloadable pdf's of the sheet music and an audio player should the user need extra tools.

The app features a search bar to access the tunes that are in the database.
